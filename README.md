# Uhmegle-Country-Blocker
Blocks Specific Countrys On Omegle 

This code is in no way perfect and is honestly a rushed after thought as i have other projects for uhmegle that im working on (i dont plan on releasing some of them but i might)

You can either use this as a Tampermonkey script or alternatively you copy it and paste it into the console comand on omegle text/video mode (press F12 and click on console)

I have by blocked by default Indian Subcontinent, Muslim-Majority, Southeast Asia, Middle East, Central Asia (mostly due to communication barriers) but you can change this im sure its not to complicated. altho you can just use the clear button and choose the countries you want 

If anything in this is broken DM me on discord over at Phoxphor but everything appears to be working fine for me
